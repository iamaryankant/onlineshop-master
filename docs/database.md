Database

## Introduction

## ODM

For communicating with database and making operations we are using mongoose ODM library. We are implementing our own features on the top of these ODM in class SiteDbGateway at server/dbgateway.mjs. Some features are for example insertChild, getChildren, ect... for a given node model. We will need to develop some utilities related to the database schema definition. Mongoose has a schema definition system and we are using it in server/dbschema.mjs.

Database collections names are based in the schema definition model names, but hey are not the same, they are a version of them following this rule:
- Collection names for mongoose models: Mongoose automatically looks for the plural, lowercased version of your model name

At the python case we are using pymongo ODM library. To adapt it for the mongoose schema definition we are making a database schema from dictionaries at server/dbschema.py.


## Formatos

Las fechas en la base de datos estan en formato Date. Al ser transferidas en formato JSON se realizan a trav√©s del procedimiento objectoDate.toISOSstring(), dando como resultado algo como: "2022-10-30T08:55:18.009Z"
